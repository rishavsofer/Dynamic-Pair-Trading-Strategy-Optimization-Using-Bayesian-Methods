# Dynamic-Pair-Trading-Strategy-Optimization-Using-Bayesian-Methods
This project explores a dynamic pair trading strategy using Bayesian optimization for Z-score thresholds. It includes cointegration analysis, Bollinger Band-based signals, and backtesting. Our aim is to identify effective parameter combinations for maximizing risk-adjusted returns while leveraging technical and statistical tools.
